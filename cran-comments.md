Resubmission
------------

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Updated the DESCRIPTION file to comply with CRAN policies.

-   Reduced the complexity of examples, thus decreasing the time needed
    to run them below 5s. More complex examples are available in the
    reference manual, but won't run when example() is called.

-   Fixed a minor bug.

Test environments
-----------------

-   local Win 8.1 install, R 3.2.3
-   Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.2.3
-   win-builder, R.3.3.0 (R-Devel)

R CMD check results
-------------------

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

win-builder produced one NOTE, suggesting "multi-factor" as a spelling
error in the DESCRIPTION file. However, this is standard notation in the
industry.

Downstream dependencies
-----------------------

There are currently no downstream dependencies.

Thank you for your consideration!
