Description: This package contains the BDA() function that performs a beta drift
    analysis, typically for multi-factor asset pricing models. The BDA() function
    tests the underlying model parameters for drift across time, drift across model
    horizon, and applies a jackknife procedure to the baseline model. This allows
    the users to draw conclusions about the stability of model parameters or make
    inferences about the behavior of funds. For example, the drift of parameters 
    for active funds could be interpreted as implicit style drift or, in the case of
    passive funds, management's inability to track a benchmark completely.
