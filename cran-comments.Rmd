## Version 1.2.2 Submission
In this version I have:

* Included the BDA.loader convenience function

* Deleted the progress bar from BDA function to ensure usability on virtual machines without display

* Fixed a bug in the horizon plot

* Corrected the calculation of confidence intervals

## Test environments
* local Win 10 install, R 3.2.4
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.2.4
* win-builder, R.3.3.0 (R-Devel)


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

win-builder produced one NOTE, suggesting "multi-factor" as a spelling error in the DESCRIPTION file. However, this is standard notation in the industry.  


## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.

##Thank you for your consideration!
