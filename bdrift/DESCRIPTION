Description: This package contains the BDA() function that performs a beta drift
    analysis, typically for multi-factor asset pricing models. The BDA() function
    tests the underlying model parameters for drift across time, drift across
    model horizon, and applies a jackknife procedure to the baseline model. This 
    allows the users to draw conclusions about the stability of model parameters 
    or make inferences about the behavior funds. The drift of parameters for active 
    funds could be interpreted as a style drift or lack of management skill in the 
    case of passive funds.
